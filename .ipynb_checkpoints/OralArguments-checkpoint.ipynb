They've never decided whether or\\n            5    not the passenger compartment and all of the closed\\n            6    containers, the glove box, the pocket on the side of the\\n            7    door were still within the actual grabbing area of Mr.\\n            8    Thomas.\\n            9              In fact, the record is rather sparse with regard\\n           10    to the facts.
