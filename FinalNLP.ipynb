Deborah C. Moran.•Mr. Roberts.•ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.•ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER•MR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and•may it please the Court:•ERISA preemption cases can be exceedingly•complicated, but our submission this morning is•\\nstraightforward. This Court held in Pilot Life that•ERISA\\'s civil enforcement provisions were the exclusive•\\nremedy for improper processing of a claim for benefits•\\nunder an ERISA-regulated plan. The Illinois independent•external review law at issue in this case affords a•\\ndifferent remedy for a beneficiary dissatisfied with an•\\nHMO\\'s denial of benefits. The Illinois law is therefore•preempted.•Just last week, in Great West Life, this Court•began its analysis by noting that it was especially•\\nreluctant to tamper with ERISA\\'s enforcement scheme, and•\\nby quoting prior precedent for the proposition that that•\\nenforcement scheme indicated that Congress did not intend•3 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

That same language, quoted in Great West Life,•was quoted 15 years ago in Pilot Life. ERISA\\'s remedies•are exclusive, whether we\\'re talking about additional•\\nFederal remedies or additional State remedies.•QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, could you help me with•one part of the facts I\\'m a little puzzled about? Your•opponents argue there\\'s a difference between the plan and•\\nthe HMO, and that he claims that you -- what you say would•\\napply to a suit against the plan, but this is a suit•\\nagainst the HMO, and I have been unable to find the plan•\\nin the papers. Is the plan in the record?•MR. ROBERTS: The respondent alleged in the•complaint, joint appendix page 32 and 38, that the•\\ncertificate of coverage was the plan, and that is in the•\\nrecord. It is Exhibit A to the complaint.•QUESTION: The certificate of coverage -- who•are the parties to the certificate of coverage?•MR. ROBERTS: The certificate of coverage is an•agreement between the HMO and the employer that extends to•\\nparticular employees the benefits that are set forth•\\nthere.•QUESTION: And in your view, you say -- are they•just hooked by their allegation, or do you think it\\'s•\\nclear that that is the correct -- that is the plan?•4 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

ROBERTS: I think they\\'re first bound by•their allegation, but second of all, even if other•\\ndocuments also contribute terms to the plan, certainly the•\\ncertificate of coverage indicates elements of the plan. •\\nThere may be other documents that set forth other terms of•\\nthe plan.•QUESTION: You see, they say that\\'s an insurance•policy that is purchased by the plan, in effect. •\\nThat\\'s -- and that therefore there\\'s a distinction between•\\nthe plan and the insurance policy, and I know you•\\ndisagree. You say the HMO is not an insurance policy, but•is there -- explain to me why that\\'s totally wrong.•MR. ROBERTS: Well, it\\'s totally wrong because•the question is not how the State law operates to grant a•\\nnew remedy to a beneficiary. We think it\\'s irrelevant•whether it operates on the insurance policy or whether it•\\noperates on the plan. The point is, however it operates,•it provides beneficiaries, under an ERISA-regulated plan,•\\nwith a new remedy, and that remedy is one that\\'s not•\\ngranted by Congress in ERISA, and the Court in Pilot Life•\\nsaid only the remedies that are granted are available.•QUESTION: Of course, one could also say it\\'s•not really a new remedy, it\\'s a new protection, sort of•\\nlike the -- see, the question is whether Pilot Life•\\ncontrols or the Massachusetts case controls.

The only thing that is at•issue in this independent external review is coverage, for•\\na number of reasons. First of all, the treatment had•already taken place. There was no question of treatment. •But coverage is all that Rush HMO has undertaken to•\\nprovide. It does not provide health care. It doesn\\'t•provide -- it agrees to pay for health care.•QUESTION: Well, this particular -- I\\'m assuming•in answer to your -- from your answer to Justice Stevens,•\\nI\\'m assuming that in this case it is so, but their•\\nargument is, you can have HMO\\'s that have nothing to do•\\nwith ERISA plans, and you can have ERISA plans that don\\'t•\\nemploy HMO\\'s to provide welfare benefits, and therefore•\\nit\\'s appropriate to think of this as a medical decision or•\\nas a regulation of medical practice in a particular form,•\\nrather than insurance, so once again there\\'s -- the•\\nproblem is that the facts do not place this in a clear•\\ncategory.•MR.

Even if the•State is purporting to articulate its definition of•\\nmedical necessity, that\\'s not the question.

That was -- the heavy•lifting in the Pilot Life opinion was reconciling the•\\nexclusivity of the civil remedies and the Saving Clause. •\\nYou can look at it one of two ways. If you give the•Savings Clause full force, then the remedies aren\\'t going•\\nto be exclusive in a case involving an insurer. If you•give the exclusivity of ERISA\\'s remedies full force, then•\\nthe Savings Clause is relegated to a lower status, and --•QUESTION: Well, we had a case, U-N-U-M v.

ROBERTS: UNUM did not involve a remedy. It•said, the question under Pilot Life and 502 was, quote,•\\nnot implicated, because it wasn\\'t a State remedy that they•\\nwere trying to save under the insurance Savings Clause. •\\nIt was a rule of decision.

The State is making something timely, giving•the beneficiary a chance to collect that the plan itself•\\nwould not have given.•MR. ROBERTS: I think that\\'s correct.

That\\'s not the line we\\'re•10 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

The line we\\'re advocating is between mandated•coverage, what does term, what does the plan have to•\\nprovide, and UNUM said, one thing it has to provide,•\\nwhatever the coverage is, coverage for those claims that•\\nare filed in a timely manner, or, if not, that did not•\\nprejudice the insurer.•This is different. This is not a new term of•coverage. It\\'s a remedy. If you don\\'t like what the HMO•has done with your benefits claim, you get to go to a•\\nState law, independent external reviewer, and get it•\\noverturned, and --•QUESTION: But it\\'s a different kind of remedy•than saying, for example, punitive damages. It\\'s --•MR. ROBERTS: It --•QUESTION: And I thought that\\'s what Pilot Life•was about.•MR. ROBERTS: The argument is made that this is•okay because all you get are the benefits that you\\'re•\\nentitled to under the plan. We think that the Taylor•\\ndecision, decided the same day as Pilot Life, rejects that•\\nargument. It says that one of the claims in that case was•for the benefits due under the plan, not punitive damages,•\\nnot emotional distress, the plan benefits, and the Court•\\nsaid, that\\'s not only preemptive, that\\'s completely•\\npreemptive.•11 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

ROBERTS: No. I think that\\'s certainly an•open question. The issue there would be --•QUESTION: I don\\'t see how it\\'s open under your•view.•MR. ROBERTS: Arbitration -- it\\'s the difference•between a voluntary agreement between parties, which is•\\nwhat ERISA seeks to enforce, and something that\\'s•\\ncompelled by State law. The analogy that the Solicitor•General draws to the collective bargaining --•QUESTION: But under your rationale, 502•controls. It\\'s a remedy. So how could a private agreement•to arbitrate survive under your theory?•MR. ROBERTS: Well, it would survive because it•would be regarded as an internal plan procedure, not --•QUESTION: But wouldn\\'t it also conflict --•wouldn\\'t it also conflict with the statutory provision?•MR. ROBERTS: No. No. I mean, the -- ERISA•allows internal remedies, appeals within the plan, and•\\nagain it\\'s an open question, but we don\\'t dispute that the•\\narbitration would be allowed.•12 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

Yes,•you can have voluntary arbitration, even where remedies•\\nare preempted, but surely a State law that directed that•\\nparties to a collective bargaining agreement must•\\narbitrate, and here\\'s how they must arbitrate, would be•\\npreempted by the Labor Management Relations Act.•If you pursue the analogy to a situation that\\'s•comparable to this case, the conclusion that there\\'s•\\npreemption seems to follow inexorably, and the idea that•\\neverything is all right because at the end of the day you•\\nhave to enforce this in a section 502 action really makes•\\na hollow shell out of Pilot Life. You have to sometimes•enforce arbitration in court, but we still think of•\\narbitration as a different remedy. We don\\'t say, that\\'s a•judicial remedy because it has to be enforced.•QUESTION: Yes, but there\\'s another difference•with Pilot Life, and that, the only question is whether it•\\nrelated to the insurance. Here, you have -- you admit•it\\'s related, but then you get onto the second ball game•\\nof whether it\\'s a change in the insurance coverage, and•\\none can look at this, I think -- I just need -- I want you•\\nto comment on this -- as not changing a term of the plan,•\\nbut, rather, changing a term of the insurance policy•\\npurchased by the plan.•13 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

ROBERTS: And we actually go on to the third•game which is, if it conflicts with the substantive term•\\nof ERISA, and this is what Pilot Life held, it is•\\npreempted, and this conflicts with the exclusivity of the•\\nremedies.•We don\\'t believe, when you go through the usual•insurance Savings Clause factors, that this is the•\\nregulation of insurance, but what Pilot Life held, and•\\nthis was the important part of the decision, which was•\\nunanimous, is that when you look at the Savings Clause you•\\nhave to be informed by an understanding of what Congress•\\nwas trying to do with the exclusive remedies, that the•\\nmost important -- quote, most important consideration in•\\ndeciding whether that remedy in that case is covered by•\\nthe Savings Clause was that Congress said that all the•\\nremedies were exclusive. If you allow them back into this•back door of the Savings Clause, then that exclusivity is•\\ngoing to be completely undermined. That\\'s the issue•that\\'s here before the Court.•QUESTION: That is -- I\\'d like to expand just a•little, because I\\'m actually trying to work out what\\'s the•\\nframework within which we think of this, and I had thought•\\nthat that part of Pilot Life was really part of the reason•\\nfor interpreting the Savings Clause as it was there•\\ninterpreted, that normally what you do is ask the first•14 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

Stop right there.•But then maybe Pilot Life adds something else,•which says, but it couldn\\'t just say if there\\'s a conflict•\\nthat brought you into preemption in the first place, well,•\\nthe Federal Government wins, because that would be to•\\neviscerate the meaning of the Savings Clause. Now, that\\'s•the framework in my mind, and I\\'d appreciate anything you•\\ncould help with that.•MR. ROBERTS: And again, that poses sort of a•conflict between what the Court in Pilot Life said were•\\nthe exclusive remedies and the Savings Clause. That is•what this Court unanimously decided 15 years ago in Pilot•\\nLife when it said, when we look at the Savings Clause, the•\\nmost important thing -- most important thing -- is to keep•\\nin mind the remedies are supposed to be exclusive, so that•\\nif this is a remedy, it is a regulation of ERISA, it is•\\nnot the regulation of insurance, and the Court reaffirmed•\\nthat approach in the John Hancock case where it said, and•\\nI\\'ll just quote one sentence, no decision of this Court•15 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

That•question was addressed. That was -- and I\\'ll say it•again, that was the hard part of the opinion in Pilot•\\nLife, and that was reaffirmed in John Hancock, and --•QUESTION: I see that. Then I\\'d think what•you\\'re saying, I take it, is at least where the conflict•\\nis particularly severe, it\\'s perhaps not -- the State•\\ndoesn\\'t necessarily win, and you think this is a•\\nparticularly bad one.•MR. ROBERTS: Well, I do think it\\'s particularly•bad, but I don\\'t think it has to be. I think if the State•law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the•\\nFederal objectives, it is preempted. The Federal•objective requires exclusivity with respect to remedies. •\\nThis obviously stands as an obstacle to that objective and•\\nso is preempted.•Now, they say it\\'s saved because the last stop•in this State law remedy is a quick dash into Federal•\\ncourt to get a stamp that says, enforce. The State law•says, if the reviewer says you\\'ve got to provide this, the•16 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

It also•raises very serious Article III concerns, because Federal•\\ncourts are not supposed to be looking at decisions made•\\nby -- made under State law that they have no authority to•\\nreview and simply rubber-stamping them, and it gives rise•\\nto the bizarre results that the respondent and the•\\nSolicitor General support in this case that an action to•\\nenforce section 4-10 is completely preempted so that•\\nthere\\'s jurisdiction, but then it turns out section 4-10•\\nis not preempted at all. That\\'s a very curious result,•but they have to maintain --•QUESTION: What is section 4-10, Mr. Roberts?•MR. ROBERTS: 4-10 is the State law, of the•Illinois HMO act.

ROBERTS: Or someone to whom that discretion•has been delegated under ERISA, and there\\'s a provision in•\\nERISA that allows them to say, this is the entity that is•\\ngoing to make the final decision. Under 503, that is a•fiduciary decision, the final denial or grant of benefits. •\\nThat\\'s the Federal remedy.•The State remedy is, the independent external•reviewer makes his or her decision, and that decision is•\\nbinding and final. Those are two very different remedies,•ERISA\\'s remedies are supposed to be exclusive, and the•\\ndecision below undermining that exclusivity should be•\\nreversed.•QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, before you sit down,•would you just give me a moment of your views on whether•\\nor not it\\'s appropriate to regard the HMO as an insurance•\\ncompany?•23 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

ROBERTS: The HMO is properly regarded as an•insurance company when it is engaged in the business of•\\ninsurance. Just because it\\'s an insurance company doesn\\'t•mean that all of its activities, including claims•\\nprocessing, for example, are necessarily the business of•\\ninsurance.•QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roberts.•Mr. Albers, we\\'ll hear from you.•ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL P. ALBERS•MR. ALBERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it•please the Court:•Illinois section 4-10 is an insurance law that•does not conflict with ERISA section 502 or this Court\\'s•\\ndecision in Pilot Life, and therefore it is enforceable to•\\nprotect the interests of Illinois Insureds like Deborah•\\nMoran.•QUESTION: Does the Illinois law provide for•review in Illinois State courts?•MR. ALBERS: The Illinois law does not provide•one way or the other. Section 4-10 does not say that. •This case was reviewed and was enforced by the Seventh•\\nCircuit as a 502 action.•QUESTION: But the action was originally brought•in State court, was it not?•MR.ALBERS: I originally brought the action in•24 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

Judge•Conlon initially remanded the case after it was removed,•\\nfinding that the medical necessity portion of the statute•\\ndid not offend Pilot Life or section 502.•Back in State court, Judge Kinnaird in Chancery•found that medical necessity did not offend 502 and•\\nordered a medical necessity review. The medical necessity•review determined that the procedure was medically•\\nnecessary. It was then -- I then sought payment of the•benefit, and that was removed to Federal court and Judge•\\nConlon found that was a 502 action.•QUESTION: If the Seventh Circuit view is upheld•by this Court, in the future would actions lie in State•\\ncourt to enforce this, or just under 502?•MR. ALBERS: I think consistent with the Court\\'s•502 ruling in Pilot Life, it would be a 502 action to seek•\\nbenefits. I think there\\'s a different question with•respect to whether it was just the enforcement of the•\\nstatute which requires medical necessity. I don\\'t think•that then you\\'re seeking the benefit, and I submit that it•25 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

ALBERS: Pilot Life did not talk about who•the decision-maker would be. Pilot Life talked about the•enforcement of the benefit had to be in Federal court•\\nunder 502. Pilot Life was a State common law cause of•action which was not an insurance law in bad faith and in•\\ncontract which sought compensatory and punitive damages•\\nbeyond the benefit.

ALBERS: And this gets down to the issue of•what a remedy is, and I looked up remedy in Black\\'s Law•\\nDictionary, and it has two elements. It has the process,•some courts have found, and it also has the result of the•\\nprocess, the enforcement, and I think in Pilot Life the•\\nCourt was talking about the enforcement, not the means of•\\nreaching it.•QUESTION: Okay, consistent with that, in a•shorthand kind of way we refer to this as an arbitration,•\\nor as an arbitration decision. Is the independent•reviewer acting really as an arbitrator in the classic•\\nsense? I\\'m assuming that an arbitrator in the classic•sense listens to evidence in arguments and decides which•\\nof those evidence and arguments is the better according to•\\nsome legal standard.•I have assumed, contrast, that what the•independent review here is doing is not only listening to•\\nother people, but making a medical judgment himself, as a•\\nphysician. If the latter is true, then it doesn\\'t seem to•me that it is a classic example of arbitration, but I may•\\nbe wrong on that, and I don\\'t want to lead you in the•\\ndirection of an analysis that ultimately will not pan out. •\\nAm I right in distinguishing true arbitration from this,•\\nor should we regard this as true arbitration imposed by•\\nState law?•29 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

ALBERS: I think this is not -- I think•you\\'re right, and I think this is not true arbitration as•\\nimposed by State law. I think the Court found in Pegram•that medical necessity decisions contain both elements of•\\ncoverage determination and elements of a medical --•QUESTION: What is --•QUESTION: May I just ask one -- they did in•that case, but my concern is, is that true here? In•other words, what can you tell me about the terms under•\\nwhich the reviewer acts that says this is, and in part at•\\nleast, or ultimately, an independent decision by the•\\nreviewer about medical necessity as opposed to an•\\nadjudication of which side has the better claim, which an•\\narbitrator might make?•MR. ALBERS: The statute itself, 4-10, requires•an independent review by a physician in the relevant•\\nspecialty. The statute doesn\\'t provide any further•guidance with respect to how that review is going to be•\\ndone. In this case, it was done de novo. It was done by•supplying the relevant definition of medical necessity to•\\na reviewer from the insurance contract certificate, and•\\nproviding all the relevant medical records.•QUESTION: Does it matter under Illinois, under•the Illinois law, whether there\\'s an adequate treatment•\\nthat\\'s less expensive?•30 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

ALBERS: No. It\\'s de novo review by the•independent reviewer.•QUESTION: And there\\'s no element in it of•determining whether there\\'s a slightly less effective•\\nremedy, but with fewer risks and less costly? That\\'s•irrelevant?•MR. ALBERS: The statute doesn\\'t address that. •I think that if that was a part of the definition of•\\nmedical necessity that was in the insurance contract•\\ndocument, that would be relevant to the reviewer\\'s•\\ndecision.•QUESTION: It can be in the insurance contract,•those provisions? It wouldn\\'t conflict with Illinois law?•MR. ALBERS: Illinois law does not define•medical necessity, and so for our analysis we\\'ve assumed•\\nthe only place that the reviewer could go would be to the•\\nplan documents and the plan document here is -- there is•\\nno plan document, but the relevant portion of the plan•\\ndocument is the insurance contract which defined medical•\\nnecessity, and that\\'s what the reviewer used, and that\\'s•\\nmy understanding of what they intended.•QUESTION: And how did they define it? What was•the definition?•MR. ALBERS: There were a variety of factors to•consider. What are the available treatments? Are they•31 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

I\\'m trying•to --•QUESTION: You asked whether, suppose -- I think•Justice O\\'Connor asked you, suppose there was effective•\\ntreatment that was less expensive, would this particular•\\ntreatment still be a medical necessity, and I thought you•\\nanswered yes to that question.•MR. ALBERS: I think that\\'s up to the judgment•of the independent reviewing physician. He certainly can•take into account whether there\\'s an equally efficacious•\\ntreatment available that\\'s less expensive, and then reach •\\nhis judgment as to which one he or she believes is•\\nmedically necessary in that circumstance.•32 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

The conclusion that you drew is that•this is not really arbitration because it\\'s a doctor. •\\nWhat would it take to make it a remedy of arbitration? •\\nWhy isn\\'t it arbitration? Suppose a lawyer -- suppose the•Illinois law read just the way it reads now, except it•\\nwouldn\\'t be a medical doctor who posses on this but,•\\nrather, a lawyer who would hear medical testimony from•\\nboth sides. Would that, putting a lawyer in the shoes,•convert it to arbitration?•MR. ALBERS: My understanding of what Justice•Souter asked me was that it had the traditional elements•\\nof what we consider an arbitration, which is, you review•\\nthe evidence from both sides, they have an opportunity to•\\nargue, and then you make a decision, and that\\'s what I•\\nmeant when I said it\\'s not classic arbitration. It is•like arbitration, in that you give it to a neutral third•\\nparty who then makes their review.•QUESTION: There are no submissions to the•doctor in this situation?•MR. ALBERS: The Illinois law does not•provide -- and actually what -- for the specifics of that,•\\nwhat it does say is that the HMO must set up the•\\nindependent review mechanism, and there is no authority in•\\nIllinois on what that must contain or not contain.•33 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

ALBERS: All I can tell you is what happened•in this case, Your Honor. In this case, the HMO submitted•a series of questions to the doctor, one of which was --•\\nand it included a lot of the elements that Justice•\\nGinsburg asked about and Justice Souter asked about with•\\nrespect to, what are the available treatments, are they•\\nless expensive treatments, what are the risks, and so on,•\\nand then he was given all of the relevant medical records•\\nand given the definition of medical necessity, and he made•\\na determination that this particular surgery was medically•\\nnecessary.•QUESTION: And what about your client? Did you•put any questions to the doctor?•MR. ALBERS: We did not, because they covered•all the questions we thought were relevant.•QUESTION: You mean, you don\\'t actually want to•know how the system works in Illinois?

ALBERS: I think the Court in Pegram -- and•it wasn\\'t the issue before the Court in Pegram, but said•\\nthat HMO\\'s act like insurers and transfer risks like•\\ninsurers, and the Illinois statute defines an HMO as an•\\nentity that bears risk.•QUESTION: That\\'s why I gave my example, because•I wanted you to see that virtually every manufacturer of•\\nthe United States is a insurer in that sense, and so is•\\nthis the kind of thing that Illinois has traditionally•\\nregulated? Is it the kind of thing that other insurance•commissioners have tended to regulate? What makes this an•insurer different from General Motors?•MR. ALBERS: Yes to both those questions.

It contains a procedural element of medical•necessity, which is the relevant rule decision, just as•\\nthe UNUM case determined that the notice prejudice rule•\\nwas the relevant rule of decision, and it contains a•\\nsubstantive element, which is a mandated benefit term. •\\nOnce the medical necessity determination is made, that is•\\na mandated benefit, and I submit to accept petitioner\\'s•\\nargument this Court would have to reverse its decisions in•\\nUNUM, in Metropolitan, and in FMC.•The effect -- I think Justice O\\'Connor raises•39 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

KNEEDLER•ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAEMR.•KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:•The claim is made here that the section 4-10 of•the Illinois HMO act conflicts with section 502(a). In•considering that claim, it\\'s important to focus on the•\\nlanguage of exactly what 502(a) addresses, and it is set•\\nout on page 2 of the petition. 502(a) is empowered --•QUESTION: 502 of the petition?•MR. KNEEDLER: Of the petition, yes. It\\'s•entitled, \"Persons Empowered to Bring a Civil Action,\" and•\\nthen it itemizes -- it then continues, a civil action may•\\nbe brought by various persons, and then it goes on to•41 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

In other words, the•preemptive scope of section 502(a) has to do with causes•\\nof action, civil suits in court, and the judicial relief•\\nthat may be awarded in court, and that is precisely the•\\nformulation that the Court used in Pilot Life itself.•At the conclusion of the Court\\'s opinion in•Pilot Life, the Court said in distinguishing Metropolitan•\\nLife, the Court said the Court in Metropolitan Life had no•\\noccasion to consider the question presented in this case,•\\nwhether Congress might clearly express through 502(a) an•\\nintention that Federal, the Federal remedy provided by•\\nthat provision displaced State causes of action, and•\\nthat\\'s what the question was about in UNUM.•Here, section 4 -- excuse me, in Pilot Life.•Here, section 4-10 of the Illinois HMO statute•does not provide a State cause of action in court, and it•\\ndoes not provide any remedy or relief beyond what\\'s•\\navailable under the plan itself.•QUESTION: Well, you could look at it that way,•or you could look at it that it provides, the State law•\\nprovides a cause of action before this arbitrator.•MR.

KNEEDLER: Well, I -- my point is, that\\'s•what section 502(a) addresses, and the analysis in Pilot•\\nLife was, what does 502(a) displace, and it\\'s -- another•\\nimportant feature of Pilot Life is, the Court went through•\\nthe various remedies that section 502(a) provides, and•\\ntellingly discussed this Court\\'s decision in Russell in•\\nwhich the Court held that punitive damages were not•\\navailable in a suit against a fiduciary based on claims•\\nprocessing, and the Court said it was not going to allow a•\\nState cause of action to displace Congress\\' judgment about•\\ndamage remedies to allow and not to allow, or have --•QUESTION: Well, Mr. Kneedler, supposing the•State provided for a very elaborate arbitration procedure,•\\nyou know, with right to counsel, specified the way the•43 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

KNEEDLER: Yes, and if it also did not•provide for relief beyond that was available in the plan•\\nitself.•QUESTION: Well, supposing that after that you•could just simply bring an action under 502?•MR. KNEEDLER: I think that would not be•preempted.

Just assume•the absurd example in which the State provided that there•\\nare going to be sort of 10 steps of arbitration and review•\\nbetween the initial denial by the plan fiduciary and the•\\nright to sue, so that someone would be tied up for months•\\nor years before the person could get into court.•In each instance, I\\'m assuming that it would not•be a provision by the State of a cause of action in the•44 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

The•problem here is that under the plan, the plan manager\\'s•\\ndetermination was to be given deference by the Federal•\\ncourt in deciding whether the plan had been complied with,•\\nwhereas under the scheme set up by the State, his•\\ndetermination is not to be given deference. It\\'s this•third party who\\'s been brought in who will have the last•\\nword, and unless that\\'s arbitrary, the court will enforce•\\nwhat he says. How can that possibly be regarded as the•same remedy that ERISA provided?•MR. KNEEDLER: Nothing in section 502 -- and•this Court made this clear in Firestone -- specifies the•\\nstandard of review. The Court therefore looked to•background principles of law there, in trust law. The•Court here might look to background principles of•46 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

That would be a classic•regulation of State insurance law.•I want to mention one other point about the•characterization of Pilot Life, and that is this Court\\'s•\\ndecision in UNUM. The Court there said, whatever the•merits of UNUM\\'s view of section 502(a)\\'s preemptive•\\nforce, the issue is not implicated here. The Court then•went on to say why, because Ward sued under 502(a)(1)(B)•\\nitself to recover benefits it was not a displacement of•\\nthe Federal remedy, it was an invocation of the Federal•\\nremedy to recover benefits, and the Court said in that•\\ncause of action, the notice prejudice rule of California•\\ninsurance law supplied the rule of decision.•So, too, here, in the cause of action under•section 502(a)(1)(B) the State Illinois HMO law supplies•\\nthe rule of decision, a procedure for an independent•\\nreviewer to give a quick, prompt review of the claim, and•\\nthat independent reviewer\\'s decision is -- then supplies•\\nthe rule of decision that the HMO must comply with, and•\\nthat is then subject to review in Federal court.•The claimant\\'s right to go to court is not•47 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

He can seek review of the arbitrator\\'s•decision, or, as we point out in our brief, he can bypass•\\nthis procedure altogether and can go directly to court,•\\nand so 502(a)(1)(B) confers rights on claimants, not on•\\nplans. Nothing in the HMO act stands as an obstacle to•the claimant\\'s ability to go directly to court.•Another important point about UNUM is, the Court•made clear that the processing of claims under an•\\ninsurance policy, it is an integral part of that insurance•\\npolicy, but at the same time States may regulate the•\\nprocess by which claims are adjudicated, and that is•\\nprecisely what the State has done in this case. It has•provided a familiar mechanism. 40 States now have•provided for this external sort of review, and it is•\\ncommon in insurance and medical practice to provide by•\\nsecond opinions by physicians, so what has been provided•\\nhere is a very familiar sort of approach.•One other point about section 502, it\\'s•patterned after section 301 of the LMRA, an arbitration•\\npreceding judicial review is a very familiar aspect of•\\njudicial review under section 301. Section 301 itself•does not provide for any particular standard of review. •\\nYou can have de novo breach of contract suits, as in the•\\nBowen v. Postal Service case we mentioned in our brief, or•\\nhighly deferential standards of review where the•48 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

It can have a•direct de novo cause of action, as the Court contemplated•\\nin Firestone, or, where the parties\\' underlying agreement•\\nor contract provides for a separate resolution process,•\\nthere is deference to that process under section 502.•QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.•Mr. Roberts, you have 4 minutes remaining.•REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.•ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER•MR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.•My friend Mr. Kneedler again drew the analogy to•the Labor Management Relations Act, and we are on common•\\nground. That\\'s a good analogy. He again stopped one step•short. A State law that compelled the parties to a•collective bargaining agreement to resolve their disputes•\\nin a particular manner, even arbitration, would surely be•\\npreempted under the Labor Management Relations Act and, to•\\nthe extent this remedy is similar to arbitration, that•\\nsame conclusion applies.•We heard that there\\'s no interference with 502•because beneficiaries have the option. They can use the•Federal remedy, or they can use the State remedy. The•existence of an alternative remedy is, in fact, an•49 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

We\\'re going to give, say, employees a Federal•remedy, but for the employers we\\'re going to make it•\\nexclusive. To say that additional remedies are okay so•long as the employee can still resort to the Federal•\\nremedy seems to ignore the typical dynamic of preemption.•And as far as the arbitration analogy goes, the•fact that the plans may or may not be able to voluntarily•\\nadopt such a remedy doesn\\'t mean the State can compel it. •\\nNothing prevented the plan in Egelhoff from voluntarily•\\nopting the beneficiary designation rule at issue there. •\\nthat didn\\'t keep this Court from ruling that it was•\\npreempted. Nothing preempted the plan in Greater•Washington Board of Trade from saying, we\\'re going to•\\nprovide the same level of benefit to people on Worker\\'s•\\nComp as to others, and yet a rule mandating that was•\\npreempted.•We\\'re dealing here with a compelled alternative•State law remedy that changes completely the standard of•\\nreview available under the Federal remedy. It\\'s not•surprising the results under the two remedies came out•\\ndifferently. That additional remedy is preempted.•50 Alderson Reporting Company 1111 14th Street, N.W.

plan. the illinois independent•external review law at issue in this case affords a• different remedy for a beneficiary dissatisfied with an• hmo\\'s denial of benefits. the illinois law is therefore•preempted.•just last week, in great west life, this court•began its analysis by noting that it was especially• reluctant to tamper with erisa\\'s enforcement scheme, and• by quoting prior precedent for the proposition that that• enforcement scheme indicated that congress did not intend•3 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo washington, dc 20005 12

in pilot life. erisa\\'s remedies•are exclusive, whether we\\'re talking about additional• federal remedies or additional state remedies.•question: mr. roberts, could you help me with•one part of the facts i\\'m a little puzzled about? your•opponents argue there\\'s a difference between the plan and• the hmo, and that he claims that you -- what you say would• apply to a suit against the plan, but

you see, they say that\\'s an insurance•policy that is purchased by the plan, in effect. • that\\'s -- and that therefore there\\'s a distinction between• the plan and the insurance policy, and i know you• disagree. you say the hmo is not an insurance policy, but•is there -- explain to me why that\\'s totally wrong.•mr. roberts: well, it\\'s totally wrong because•the question is not how the state law operates to grant a• new remedy to a beneficiary. we think it\\'s irrelevant•whether it operates on the insurance policy or whether it• operates on the plan. the point is, however it operates,•it provides beneficiaries, under an erisa-regulated plan,• with a new remedy, and that remedy is one that\\'s not• granted by congress in erisa, and the court in pilot life• said only the remedies that are granted are available.•question: of course, one could also say it\\'s•not really a new remedy, it\\'s a new protection, sort of• like the -- see, the question is whether pilot life• controls or

case it is so, but their• argument is, you can have hmo\\'s that have nothing to do• with erisa plans, and you can have erisa plans that don\\'t• employ hmo\\'s to provide welfare benefits, and therefore• it\\'s appropriate to think of this as a medical decision or• as a regulation of medical practice in a particular form,• rather than insurance, so once again there\\'s -- the• problem is that the facts do not place this in a clear• category.•mr. roberts: well, i -- with respect, i think•7 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo washington, dc 20005

to articulate its definition of• medical necessity, that\\'s not the question. the question•is, is this beneficiary entitled to benefits under this• plan, and the judgment about what is medically necessary• is something that is addressed in the plan. the plan•provides the broadest possible discretion to the hmo to• interpret the plan terms, including medical necessity.•question: well, but what if the state law in•effect tinkered with how you interpret the plan, and• spelled out that in determining what\\'s medically necessary• the plan will make use of an independent medical•

that\\'s the argument, and i•can understand that that, you could view it through that• lens, could you not?•mr. roberts: and i think, as judge posner•pointed out in his dissent, if you do that, then all bets• are off. if you say that this is incorporated by state•law into your plan, and so when you enforce that remedy,• all you\\'re doing is enforcing a term of the plan --•question: well, is that so surprising, in light•of the fact that the erisa law itself excludes regulations• of insurance? the law itself took that out of erisa•coverage, in effect.•mr. roberts: well, now that was the specific•question addressed in pilot life. that was -- the heavy•lifting in the pilot life opinion was reconciling the• exclusivity of the civil remedies and the saving clause. • you can look at it one of two ways. if you give the•savings clause full force, then the remedies aren\\'t going• to be exclusive in a case involving an insurer. if you•give the exclusivity of erisa\\'s remedies full force, then• the savings clause is relegated to a lower status, and --•question: well, we had a case, u-n-u-m v. ward,•9 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo

companies is an insurance law under the savings clause.•mr. roberts: unum did not involve a remedy. it•said, the question under pilot life and 502 was, quote,• not implicated, because it wasn\\'t a state remedy that they• were trying to save under the insurance savings clause. • it was a rule of decision. this is not a rule of•decision. it\\'s a different decision-maker, and if this•type of state law remedy is allowed, then there\\'s nothing• left --•question: but unum --•question: but mr. roberts, can --•question: -- wasn\\'t a procedural ruling. unum•was a question of how late could you file, and the state• law said you could file late, and --•mr. roberts: the law --•question: -- why should that be treated•differently? the state is making something timely, giving•the beneficiary a chance to collect that the plan itself• would not have given.•mr. roberts: i think that\\'s correct. i -- the•line is not -- and this is what unum taught. the line is•not between substance and

has to provide,• whatever the coverage is, coverage for those claims that• are filed in a timely manner, or, if not, that did not• prejudice the insurer.•this is different. this is not a new term of•coverage. it\\'s a remedy. if you don\\'t like what the hmo•has done with your benefits claim, you get to go to a• state law, independent external reviewer, and get it• overturned, and --•question:

made that this is•okay because all you get are the benefits that you\\'re• entitled to under the plan. we think that the taylor• decision, decided the same day as pilot life, rejects that• argument. it says that one of the claims in that case was•for the benefits due under the plan, not punitive damages,• not emotional distress, the plan benefits, and the court• said, that\\'s not only preemptive, that\\'s completely• preemptive.•11 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo washington, dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

it\\'s the difference•between a voluntary agreement between parties, which is• what erisa seeks to enforce, and something that\\'s• compelled by state law. the analogy that the solicitor•general draws to the collective bargaining --•question: but under your rationale, 502•controls. it\\'s a remedy. so how could a private agreement•to arbitrate survive under your theory?•mr. roberts: well, it would survive because it•would be regarded as an internal plan procedure, not --•question: but wouldn\\'t it also conflict --•wouldn\\'t it also conflict with the statutory provision?•mr. roberts: no. no. i mean, the -- erisa•allows internal remedies, appeals within the plan, and• again it\\'s an open question, but we don\\'t dispute that the• arbitration would be allowed.•12 alderson reporting company

solicitor general stops too early. yes,•you can have voluntary arbitration, even where remedies• are preempted, but surely a state law that directed that• parties to a collective bargaining agreement must• arbitrate, and here\\'s how they must arbitrate, would be• preempted by the labor management relations act.•if you pursue the analogy to a situation that\\'s•comparable to this case, the conclusion that there\\'s• preemption seems to follow inexorably, and the idea that• everything is all right because at the end of the day you• have to enforce this in a section 502 action really makes• a hollow shell out of pilot life. you have to sometimes•enforce arbitration in court, but we still think of• arbitration as a different remedy. we don\\'t say, that\\'s a•judicial remedy because it has to be enforced.•question: yes, but there\\'s another difference•with pilot life, and that, the only question is whether it• related to the insurance. here, you have -- you admit•it\\'s related, but then you get onto the second ball game• of whether it\\'s a change in the insurance coverage, and• one can look at this, i think -- i just need -- i want you• to comment on this -- as not changing a term of the plan,• but, rather, changing a term of the insurance policy• purchased by the plan.•13 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo washington, dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 mr. roberts: and we actually go on to the third•game which is, if it conflicts with the substantive term• of erisa, and this is what pilot life held, it is• preempted, and this conflicts with the exclusivity of the• remedies.•we don\\'t believe, when you go through the usual•insurance savings clause factors, that this is the• regulation of insurance, but what pilot life held, and• this was the important part of the decision, which was• unanimous, is that when you look at the savings clause you• have to be informed by an understanding of what congress• was trying to do with the exclusive remedies, that the• most important -- quote, most important consideration in• deciding whether that remedy in that case is covered by• the savings clause was that congress said that all the• remedies were exclusive. if you allow them back into this•back door of the savings clause, then that exclusivity is• going to be completely undermined. that\\'s the issue•that\\'s here before the court.•question: that is -- i\\'d like to expand just a•little, because i\\'m actually trying to work out what\\'s the• framework within which we think of this, and i had thought• that that part of pilot life was really part of the reason• for interpreting the savings clause as it was there• interpreted, that normally what you do is ask the first•14 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo washington, dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25question, is this preempted in the first place, and it is• if there\\'s field preemption, if there\\'s conflict• preemption, and maybe, with erisa, if there\\'s something• more, and ordinarily, if there is such a conflict, the• federal side wins, but the whole point of the savings• clause is to say, if there\\'s a conflict in respect to• insurance, the state wins. stop right there.•but then maybe pilot life adds something else,•which says, but it couldn\\'t just say if there\\'s a conflict• that brought you into preemption in the first place, well,• the federal government wins, because that would be to• eviscerate the meaning of the savings clause. now, that\\'s•the framework in my mind, and i\\'d appreciate anything you• could help with that.•mr. roberts: and again, that poses sort of a•conflict between what the court in pilot life said were• the exclusive remedies and the savings clause. that is•what this court unanimously decided 15 years ago in pilot• life when it said, when we look at the savings clause, the• most important thing -- most important thing -- is to keep• in mind the remedies are supposed to be exclusive, so that• if this is a remedy, it is a regulation of erisa, it is• not the regulation of insurance, and the court reaffirmed• that approach in the john hancock case where it said, and• i\\'ll just quote one sentence, no decision of this court•15 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo washington, dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25has applied the savings clause to supersede the provision• in erisa itself.•if you apply the savings clause to allow this•state law remedy to be applied, that would be superseding• what this court said section 502 of erisa meant in pilot• life, which was that these remedies are exclusive. that•question was addressed. that was -- and i\\'ll say it•again, that was the hard part of the opinion in pilot• life, and that was reaffirmed in john hancock, and --•question: i see that. then i\\'d think what•you\\'re saying, i take it, is at least where the conflict• is particularly severe, it\\'s perhaps not -- the state• doesn\\'t necessarily win, and you think this is a• particularly bad one.•mr. roberts: well, i do think it\\'s particularly•bad, but i don\\'t think it has to be. i think if the state•law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the• federal objectives, it is preempted. the federal•objective requires exclusivity with respect to remedies. • this obviously stands as an obstacle to that objective and• so is preempted.•now, they say it\\'s saved because the last stop•in this state law remedy is a quick dash into federal• court to get a stamp that says, enforce. the state law•says, if the reviewer says you\\'ve got to provide this,

say, well, that\\'s okay,• because we run into federal court, we make this a 502• action.•well, that makes pilot life ridiculous, because•it says every type of remedy is okay so long as the last• stop is a quick visit to the federal courthouse. it also•raises very serious article iii concerns, because federal• courts are not supposed to be looking at decisions made• by -- made under state law that they have no authority to• review and simply rubber-stamping them, and it gives rise• to the bizarre results that the respondent and the• solicitor general support in this case that an action to• enforce section 4-10 is completely preempted so that• there\\'s jurisdiction, but then it turns out section 4-10• is not preempted at all. that\\'s a very curious result,•but they have to maintain --•question: what is section 4-10, mr. roberts?•mr. roberts: 4-10 is the state law, of the•illinois hmo act. i\\'ve been referring to it as the•independent external review law. but they have

seem odd that if• you\\'re going in and all you\\'re doing is getting a rubber• stamp from the federal courthouse saying, enforced, that• that\\'s completely preempted, when the law isn\\'t preempted• at all.•question: well, what they\\'re -- it\\'s not•absurd, in their view, anyway, because they\\'re saying they• have a human being over here called an arbitrator and this• human being tells you what the benefit is, and what your• clients are really objecting to, frankly, is not this• remedy. they couldn\\'t care less.•what they\\'re worried about is that that human•being called the

albers: and this gets down to the issue of•what a remedy is, and i looked up remedy in black\\'s law• dictionary, and it has two elements. it has the process,•some courts have found, and it also has the result of the• process, the enforcement, and i think in pilot life the• court was talking about the enforcement, not the means of• reaching it.•question: okay, consistent with that, in a•shorthand kind of way we refer to this as an arbitration,• or as an arbitration decision. is the independent•reviewer acting really as an arbitrator in the classic• sense? i\\'m assuming that an arbitrator in the classic•sense listens to evidence in arguments and decides which• of those evidence and arguments is the better according to• some legal standard.•i have assumed, contrast, that what the•independent review here is doing is not only listening to• other people, but making a medical judgment himself, as a• physician. if the latter is true, then it doesn\\'t seem to•me that it is a classic example of arbitration, but i may• be wrong on that, and i don\\'t want to lead you in the• direction of an analysis that ultimately will not pan out. • am i right in distinguishing true

found in pegram•that medical necessity decisions contain both elements of• coverage determination and elements of a medical --•question: what is --•question: may i just ask one -- they did in•that case, but my concern is, is that true here? in•other words, what can you tell me about the terms under• which the reviewer acts that says this is, and in part at• least, or ultimately, an independent decision by the• reviewer about medical necessity as opposed to an• adjudication of which side has the better claim, which an• arbitrator might make?•mr. albers: the statute itself, 4-10, requires•an independent review by a physician in the relevant• specialty. the statute doesn\\'t provide any further•guidance with respect to how that review is going to be• done. in this case, it was done de novo. it was done by•supplying the relevant definition of medical necessity to• a reviewer from the insurance contract certificate, and• providing all the relevant medical records.•question: does it

of•determining whether there\\'s a slightly less effective• remedy, but with fewer risks and less costly? that\\'s•irrelevant?•mr. albers: the statute doesn\\'t address that. •i think that if that was a part of the definition of• medical necessity that was in the insurance contract• document, that would be relevant to the reviewer\\'s• decision.•question: it can be in the insurance contract,•those provisions? it wouldn\\'t conflict with illinois law?•mr. albers: illinois law does not define•medical necessity, and so for our analysis we\\'ve assumed• the only place that the reviewer could go would be to the• plan documents and the plan document here is -- there is• no plan document, but the relevant portion of the plan• document is the insurance contract which defined medical• necessity, and that\\'s what the reviewer used, and that\\'s• my understanding of what they intended.•question: and how did they define it? what was•the definition?•mr. albers: there were a variety of factors

the conclusion that you drew is that•this is not really arbitration because it\\'s a doctor. • what would it take to make it a remedy of arbitration? • why isn\\'t it arbitration? suppose a lawyer --

that, putting a lawyer in the shoes,•convert it to arbitration?•mr. albers: my understanding of what justice•souter asked me was that it had the traditional elements• of what we consider an arbitration, which is, you review• the evidence from both sides, they have an opportunity to• argue, and then you make a decision, and that\\'s what i• meant when i said it\\'s not classic arbitration. it is•like arbitration, in that you give it to a neutral third• party who then makes their review.•question: there are no submissions to the•doctor in this situation?•mr. albers: the

fair processing of claims and suits in court. • well, but arbitration and independent review, measures• adopted by state insurance laws of this sort, are• precisely designed to facilitate the prompt and fair and• expeditious processing of claims without having to go to• court, so it --•question: mr. kneedler, doesn\\'t it give you a•very different remedy -- i mean, to say that it isn\\'t just• a matter of delay, that isn\\'t the problem here. the•problem here is that under the plan, the plan manager\\'s• determination was to be given deference by the federal• court in deciding whether the plan had been complied with,• whereas under the scheme set up by the state, his• determination is not to be given deference. it\\'s this•third party who\\'s been brought in who will have the last• word, and unless that\\'s arbitrary, the court will enforce• what he says. how can that possibly be regarded as the•same remedy that erisa provided?•mr. kneedler: nothing in section 502 -- and•this court made this clear in firestone -- specifies the• standard of review. the court therefore looked to•background principles of law there, in trust law. the•court here might look to background principles of•46 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo washington, dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25arbitration law, and also to the terms of the plan.•state law, as justice o\\'connor pointed out,•might well be able to say that that sort of provision for• deference to the plan administrator\\'s interpretation of• the plan should not be given. that would be a classic•regulation of state insurance law.•i want to mention one other point about the•characterization of pilot life, and that is this court\\'s• decision in unum. the court there said, whatever the•merits of unum\\'s view of section 502(a)\\'s preemptive• force, the issue is not implicated here. the court then•went on to say why, because ward sued under 502(a)(1)(b)• itself to recover benefits it was not a displacement of• the federal remedy, it was an invocation of the federal• remedy to recover benefits, and the court said in that• cause of action, the notice prejudice rule of california• insurance law supplied the rule of decision.•so, too, here, in the cause of action under•section 502(a)(1)(b) the state illinois hmo law supplies• the rule of decision, a procedure for an independent• reviewer to give a quick, prompt review of the claim, and• that independent reviewer\\'s decision is -- then supplies• the rule of decision that the hmo must comply with, and• that is then subject to review in federal court.•the claimant\\'s right to go to court is not•47 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street, n.w. suite 400 1-800-for-depo

procedure altogether and can go directly to court,• and so 502(a)(1)(b) confers rights on claimants, not on• plans. nothing in the hmo act stands as an obstacle to•the claimant\\'s ability to go directly to court.•another important point about unum is, the court•made clear that the processing of claims under an• insurance policy, it is an integral part of that insurance• policy, but at the same time states may regulate the• process by which claims are adjudicated, and that is• precisely what the state has done in this case. it has•provided a familiar mechanism. 40 states now have•provided for this external sort of review, and it is• common in insurance and medical practice to provide by• second opinions by physicians, so what has been provided• here is a very familiar sort of approach.•one other point about section 502, it\\'s•patterned after section 301 of the lmra, an arbitration• preceding judicial review is a very familiar aspect of• judicial review under section 301. section 301 itself•does not provide for any particular standard of review. • you can have de novo breach of contract suits, as in the• bowen v. postal service case we mentioned in our

  chief justice rehnquist  we ll hear argument first this morning in number 00 1021  rush prudential hmo   inc  v  deborah c  moran  mr  roberts  oral argument of john g  roberts  jr  on behalf of the petitioner mr  roberts  thank you  mr  chief justice  and may it please the court  erisa preemption cases can be exceedingly complicated  but our submission this morning is  straightforward  this court held in pilot life that erisa s civil enforcement provisions were the exclusive  remedy for improper processing of a claim for benefits  under an erisa regulated plan  the illinois independent external review law at issue in this case affords a  different remedy for a beneficiary dissatisfied with an  hmo s denial of benefits  the illinois law is therefore preempted  just last week  in great west life  this court began its analysis by noting that it was especially  reluctant to tamper with erisa s enforcement scheme  and  by quoting prior precedent for the proposition that that  enforcement scheme indicated that congress did not intend 3 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25to authorize other remedies that it forgot to incorporate  expressly  that same language  quoted in great west life  was quoted 15 years ago in pilot life  erisa s remedies are exclusive  whether we re talking about additional  federal remedies or additional state remedies  question  mr  roberts  could you help me with one part of the facts i m a little puzzled about  your opponents argue there s a difference between the plan and  the hmo  and that he claims that you    what you say would  apply to a suit against the plan  but this is a suit  against the hmo  and i have been unable to find the plan  in the papers  is the plan in the record  mr  roberts  the respondent alleged in the complaint  joint appendix page 32 and 38  that the  certificate of coverage was the plan  and that is in the  record  it is exhibit a to the complaint  question  the certificate of coverage    who are the parties to the certificate of coverage  mr  roberts  the certificate of coverage is an agreement between the hmo and the employer that extends to  particular employees the benefits that are set forth  there  question  and in your view  you say    are they just hooked by their allegation  or do you think it s  clear that that is the correct    that is the plan  4 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 mr  roberts  i think they re first bound by their allegation  but second of all  even if other  documents also contribute terms to the plan  certainly the  certificate of coverage indicates elements of the plan    there may be other documents that set forth other terms of  the plan  question  you see  they say that s an insurance policy that is purchased by the plan  in effect    that s    and that therefore there s a distinction between  the plan and the insurance policy  and i know you  disagree  you say the hmo is not an insurance policy  but is there    explain to me why that s totally wrong  mr  roberts  well  it s totally wrong because the question is not how the state law operates to grant a  new remedy to a beneficiary  we think it s irrelevant whether it operates on the insurance policy or whether it  operates on the plan  the point is  however it operates  it provides beneficiaries  under an erisa regulated plan   with a new remedy  and that remedy is one that s not  granted by congress in erisa  and the court in pilot life  said only the remedies that are granted are available  question  of course  one could also say it s not really a new remedy  it s a new protection  sort of  like the    see  the question is whether pilot life  controls or the massachusetts case controls  it s an 5 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25interesting    whether it s something like a compelled  benefit or a compelled protection of some kind    mr  roberts  right  question     that the insurance company provides  mr  roberts  yes  and i think the difference is  between mandated benefits laws like massachusetts   those laws provide  as this court said in unum  a rule of  decision that is to be applied by whoever the decision   maker is in reviewing a denial of benefits  here  it s not a new rule of decision  it s a new decision maker  and that decision maker isn t looking  to state law to say  well  they ve given you mental health  coverage and so that has to be provided  he s deciding  what    whether the denial of benefits was proper or not   and that can only be characterized as a remedy  whether  it s    question  well    no  i didn t mean to interrupt  isn t the problem that he s doing two things   the decision that he makes is necessarily going to have  its consequence on whether the benefit denial was correct  or not  but he s also making a medical kind of decision   is  in fact  this reasonable medical practice  and so he s  not merely in the position which a court is in when a 6 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25court says  does the evidence show this is reasonable  medical practice  he s in the decision of  in effect  making a kind of practice decision which doctors  as  doctors  make  so it s somewhere in between  mr  roberts  we don t think that s a correct characterization  there is no element of a treatment component in this decision  the only thing that is at issue in this independent external review is coverage  for  a number of reasons  first of all  the treatment had already taken place  there was no question of treatment   but coverage is all that rush hmo has undertaken to  provide  it does not provide health care  it doesn t provide    it agrees to pay for health care  question  well  this particular    i m assuming in answer to your    from your answer to justice stevens   i m assuming that in this case it is so  but their  argument is  you can have hmo s that have nothing to do  with erisa plans  and you can have erisa plans that don t  employ hmo s to provide welfare benefits  and therefore  it s appropriate to think of this as a medical decision or  as a regulation of medical practice in a particular form   rather than insurance  so once again there s    the  problem is that the facts do not place this in a clear  category  mr  roberts  well  i    with respect  i think 7 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25the facts do place this in a very clear category  because  there s no question of treatment at issue  even if the state is purporting to articulate its definition of  medical necessity  that s not the question  the question is  is this beneficiary entitled to benefits under this  plan  and the judgment about what is medically necessary  is something that is addressed in the plan  the plan provides the broadest possible discretion to the hmo to  interpret the plan terms  including medical necessity  question  well  but what if the state law in effect tinkered with how you interpret the plan  and  spelled out that in determining what s medically necessary  the plan will make use of an independent medical  consultant  mr  roberts  well  the state law can define medical necessity  i think that s just like a mandated benefit  saying you have to    question  and can it not say  and furthermore  if there s any dispute you will use an independent medical  consultant  mr  roberts  that it cannot do consistent with pilot life  because that is a remedy for a denial of  benefits  and pilot life indicated    question  well  not necessarily  it may be more a definition in the plan  or a provision of the 8 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25insurance plan itself  and then that in turn is  enforceable under section 502  mr  roberts  well  that s    question  i mean  that s the argument  and i can understand that that  you could view it through that  lens  could you not  mr  roberts  and i think  as judge posner pointed out in his dissent  if you do that  then all bets  are off  if you say that this is incorporated by state law into your plan  and so when you enforce that remedy   all you re doing is enforcing a term of the plan    question  well  is that so surprising  in light of the fact that the erisa law itself excludes regulations  of insurance  the law itself took that out of erisa coverage  in effect  mr  roberts  well  now that was the specific question addressed in pilot life  that was    the heavy lifting in the pilot life opinion was reconciling the  exclusivity of the civil remedies and the saving clause    you can look at it one of two ways  if you give the savings clause full force  then the remedies aren t going  to be exclusive in a case involving an insurer  if you give the exclusivity of erisa s remedies full force  then  the savings clause is relegated to a lower status  and    question  well  we had a case  u n u m v  ward  9 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25and held that any statute that effectively creates a  mandatory contract term and regulates only insurance  companies is an insurance law under the savings clause  mr  roberts  unum did not involve a remedy  it said  the question under pilot life and 502 was  quote   not implicated  because it wasn t a state remedy that they  were trying to save under the insurance savings clause    it was a rule of decision  this is not a rule of decision  it s a different decision maker  and if this type of state law remedy is allowed  then there s nothing  left    question  but unum    question  but mr  roberts  can    question     wasn t a procedural ruling  unum was a question of how late could you file  and the state  law said you could file late  and    mr  roberts  the law    question     why should that be treated differently  the state is making something timely  giving the beneficiary a chance to collect that the plan itself  would not have given  mr  roberts  i think that s correct  i    the line is not    and this is what unum taught  the line is not between substance and procedure when you re talking  about mandated coverage  that s not the line we re 10 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25advocating  the line we re advocating is between mandated coverage  what does term  what does the plan have to  provide  and unum said  one thing it has to provide   whatever the coverage is  coverage for those claims that  are filed in a timely manner  or  if not  that did not  prejudice the insurer  this is different  this is not a new term of coverage  it s a remedy  if you don t like what the hmo has done with your benefits claim  you get to go to a  state law  independent external reviewer  and get it  overturned  and    question  but it s a different kind of remedy than saying  for example  punitive damages  it s    mr  roberts  it    question  and i thought that s what pilot life was about  mr  roberts  the argument is made that this is okay because all you get are the benefits that you re  entitled to under the plan  we think that the taylor  decision  decided the same day as pilot life  rejects that  argument  it says that one of the claims in that case was for the benefits due under the plan  not punitive damages   not emotional distress  the plan benefits  and the court  said  that s not only preemptive  that s completely  preemptive  11 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 erisa preempts not only different remedies  but alternative  additional remedies  question  well  under your theory there could be no private arbitration agreement by an hmo plan and  people covered by the plan  mr  roberts  no  i think that s certainly an open question  the issue there would be    question  i don t see how it s open under your view  mr  roberts  arbitration    it s the difference between a voluntary agreement between parties  which is  what erisa seeks to enforce  and something that s  compelled by state law  the analogy that the solicitor general draws to the collective bargaining    question  but under your rationale  502 controls  it s a remedy  so how could a private agreement to arbitrate survive under your theory  mr  roberts  well  it would survive because it would be regarded as an internal plan procedure  not    question  but wouldn t it also conflict    wouldn t it also conflict with the statutory provision  mr  roberts  no  no  i mean  the    erisa allows internal remedies  appeals within the plan  and  again it s an open question  but we don t dispute that the  arbitration would be allowed  12 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 the problem with the analogy to the arbitration cases is that the solicitor general stops too early  yes  you can have voluntary arbitration  even where remedies  are preempted  but surely a state law that directed that  parties to a collective bargaining agreement must  arbitrate  and here s how they must arbitrate  would be  preempted by the labor management relations act  if you pursue the analogy to a situation that s comparable to this case  the conclusion that there s  preemption seems to follow inexorably  and the idea that  everything is all right because at the end of the day you  have to enforce this in a section 502 action really makes  a hollow shell out of pilot life  you have to sometimes enforce arbitration in court  but we still think of  arbitration as a different remedy  we don t say  that s a judicial remedy because it has to be enforced  question  yes  but there s another difference with pilot life  and that  the only question is whether it  related to the insurance  here  you have    you admit it s related  but then you get onto the second ball game  of whether it s a change in the insurance coverage  and  one can look at this  i think    i just need    i want you  to comment on this    as not changing a term of the plan   but  rather  changing a term of the insurance policy  purchased by the plan  13 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 mr  roberts  and we actually go on to the third game which is  if it conflicts with the substantive term  of erisa  and this is what pilot life held  it is  preempted  and this conflicts with the exclusivity of the  remedies  we don t believe  when you go through the usual insurance savings clause factors  that this is the  regulation of insurance  but what pilot life held  and  this was the important part of the decision  which was  unanimous  is that when you look at the savings clause you  have to be informed by an understanding of what congress  was trying to do with the exclusive remedies  that the  most important    quote  most important consideration in  deciding whether that remedy in that case is covered by  the savings clause was that congress said that all the  remedies were exclusive  if you allow them back into this back door of the savings clause  then that exclusivity is  going to be completely undermined  that s the issue that s here before the court  question  that is    i d like to expand just a little  because i m actually trying to work out what s the  framework within which we think of this  and i had thought  that that part of pilot life was really part of the reason  for interpreting the savings clause as it was there  interpreted  that normally what you do is ask the first 14 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25question  is this preempted in the first place  and it is  if there s field preemption  if there s conflict  preemption  and maybe  with erisa  if there s something  more  and ordinarily  if there is such a conflict  the  federal side wins  but the whole point of the savings  clause is to say  if there s a conflict in respect to  insurance  the state wins  stop right there  but then maybe pilot life adds something else  which says  but it couldn t just say if there s a conflict  that brought you into preemption in the first place  well   the federal government wins  because that would be to  eviscerate the meaning of the savings clause  now  that s the framework in my mind  and i d appreciate anything you  could help with that  mr  roberts  and again  that poses sort of a conflict between what the court in pilot life said were  the exclusive remedies and the savings clause  that is what this court unanimously decided 15 years ago in pilot  life when it said  when we look at the savings clause  the  most important thing    most important thing    is to keep  in mind the remedies are supposed to be exclusive  so that  if this is a remedy  it is a regulation of erisa  it is  not the regulation of insurance  and the court reaffirmed  that approach in the john hancock case where it said  and  i ll just quote one sentence  no decision of this court 15 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25has applied the savings clause to supersede the provision  in erisa itself  if you apply the savings clause to allow this state law remedy to be applied  that would be superseding  what this court said section 502 of erisa meant in pilot  life  which was that these remedies are exclusive  that question was addressed  that was    and i ll say it again  that was the hard part of the opinion in pilot  life  and that was reaffirmed in john hancock  and    question  i see that  then i d think what you re saying  i take it  is at least where the conflict  is particularly severe  it s perhaps not    the state  doesn t necessarily win  and you think this is a  particularly bad one  mr  roberts  well  i do think it s particularly bad  but i don t think it has to be  i think if the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the  federal objectives  it is preempted  the federal objective requires exclusivity with respect to remedies    this obviously stands as an obstacle to that objective and  so is preempted  now  they say it s saved because the last stop in this state law remedy is a quick dash into federal  court to get a stamp that says  enforce  the state law says  if the reviewer says you ve got to provide this  the 16 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25hmo has to provide it  and they say  well  that s okay   because we run into federal court  we make this a 502  action  well  that makes pilot life ridiculous  because it says every type of remedy is okay so long as the last  stop is a quick visit to the federal courthouse  it also raises very serious article iii concerns  because federal  courts are not supposed to be looking at decisions made  by    made under state law that they have no authority to  review and simply rubber stamping them  and it gives rise  to the bizarre results that the respondent and the  solicitor general support in this case that an action to  enforce section 4 10 is completely preempted so that  there s jurisdiction  but then it turns out section 4 10  is not preempted at all  that s a very curious result  but they have to maintain    question  what is section 4 10  mr  roberts  mr  roberts  4 10 is the state law  of the illinois hmo act  i ve been referring to it as the independent external review law  but they have to maintain that facade  question  would you state the absurd positions again   laughter   question  it didn t strike me as that absurd  17 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25but    mr  roberts  what is absurd is that they have to maintain that this can only be enforced under a 502  action  that the state law claim    keep in mind this  began  of course  as a state law claim in state court    502 wasn t mentioned at all  it was recharacterized as a 502 action  they said because it s completely preempted   but the underlying remedy that s being enforced isn t  preempted at all  now  those are two different questions  jurisdiction and substance  but it does seem odd that if  you re going in and all you re doing is getting a rubber  stamp from the federal courthouse saying  enforced  that  that s completely preempted  when the law isn t preempted  at all  question  well  what they re    it s not absurd  in their view  anyway  because they re saying they  have a human being over here called an arbitrator and this  human being tells you what the benefit is  and what your  clients are really objecting to  frankly  is not this  remedy  they couldn t care less  what they re worried about is that that human being called the arbitrator is going to say that this  woman has to have a certain treatment that otherwise in  their view she wouldn t have to have  i mean  just 18 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25imagine the statute that said  instead of what it says   that you have to provide medical treatment whenever  there s a 25 percent chance of improvement  no arbitrator at all in that one  and they ll be even more excited  and  indeed  it doesn t take away the federal remedy in my  hypothetical  nor does it in this one  it just turns out that we know who s going to win  mr  roberts  well  that s because there s a different decision maker making the decision on your claim  for the denial of benefits  and that s what makes it clear  that what s involved is a different remedy  it s also a remedy that changes dramatically what the plan actually provides  and it does that by  taking away from the plan fiduciary the deference that the  fiduciary    question  is that fiduciary  a definition of his powers of review and so forth  in the record anywhere  mr  roberts  i m sorry  the    question  the    you two or three times refer to the fact that the plan gives the fiduciary this  standard of review  is that in the record  mr  roberts  no  the only elements of the plan that are in the record is the certificate of coverage   which    question  so for all we know the plan might 19 alderson reporting

maker to do shall be done  mr  roberts  well  that s what the law provides  question  i mean  maybe the plan says that  too  for all i know  mr  roberts  no  because the elements of the plan that are in the record  the certificate of coverage   notes that the hmo has the broadest possible discretion to  interpret the terms of the plan in deciding coverage and   under this court s decision in firestone    question  it says that in the certificate  mr  roberts  yes  and    pages 7 and pages 8   it s exhibit a to the complaint    and under this court s  decision in firestone  that means that that decision is  subject to a deferential review  the state law changes that  and the state law gives the decision to the independent external reviewer   who makes his decision apparently de novo  so that the  precise thing that the plan participants  parties  contracted against  the recognition that this medical  necessity is a question of judgment  some people are going  to view it differently  we want to make clear that it s  our discretion that controls  and that gives us  entitlement to deferential review    20 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo

legislation introduced  at least in congress  to accomplish what  mr  roberts  my understanding of many of the pending bills is that they have an external review  provision but  of course  it s a federal one  and that is  consistent with erisa s goal of uniformity in claims  processing and administration  question  do you know anything about the status of that pending legislation  mr  roberts  no  question  no  mr  roberts  other than at various times passage is imminent  and then it falls apart  but again  it s a very different thing to say  this is the uniform  federal remedy  and to have  as your honor points out  40  different remedies  if you re running a company that has a  health care plan with operations in different states  the  health plan can t be uniformly    question  are most of the state law provisions similar to the one in illinois  mr  roberts  they all have differences  for example  in some states the independent external reviewer 21 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25is an administrative board  in michigan  it consists of seven people in certain places  in some places it s not just one person  it s more than one person  some places it consists of employee representatives as well as  physicians  but it does change what the parties contracted  for  and    question  why is that a more disturbing change than changes in what is the minimum required coverage  mr  roberts  well  i don t know that it s more disturbing  it s different  yes  the impact on an hmo can be greater if the state law says  you must provide  mental health coverage  this  this  and this  but then at  least the employer looking at it knows what s at stake   and he knows that the remedy is going to be the remedy  that is provided under federal law  which is that they re  going to enforce what i have agreed to provide under this  plan  even if what i ve agreed to provide is compelled by  state law  you know that you re not going to face all sorts of different remedies and in particular  here  if you  contract for the broadest possible discretion  you know  that when the review is undertaken your fiduciary decision  will be reviewed with appropriate deference  that is taken away here  it s taken away by giving the independent external reviewer the authority to make a de 22 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25novo decision  so that what is set up are two very  different remediary regimes  the federal regime  the fiduciary makes a decision with the broadest possible discretion  his obligation is to be faithful to the terms of the plan    that is reviewed in federal court  question  but it s not the fiduciary s decision  as i understand it  it s the insurance policy s decision  mr  roberts  or someone to whom that discretion has been delegated under erisa  and there s a provision in  erisa that allows them to say  this is the entity that is  going to make the final decision  under 503  that is a fiduciary decision  the final denial or grant of benefits    that s the federal remedy  the state remedy is  the independent external reviewer makes his or her decision  and that decision is  binding and final  those are two very different remedies  erisa s remedies are supposed to be exclusive  and the  decision below undermining that exclusivity should be  reversed  question  mr  roberts  before you sit down  would you just give me a moment of your views on whether  or not it s appropriate to regard the hmo as an insurance  company  23 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 mr  roberts  the hmo is properly regarded as an insurance company when it is engaged in the business of  insurance  just because it s an insurance company doesn t mean that all of its activities  including claims  processing  for example  are necessarily the business of  insurance  question  very well  mr  roberts  mr  albers  we ll hear from you  oral argument of daniel p  albers mr  albers  mr  chief justice  and may it please the court  illinois section 4 10 is an insurance law that does not conflict with erisa section 502 or this court s  decision in pilot life  and therefore it is enforceable to  protect the interests of illinois insureds like deborah  moran  question  does the illinois law provide for review in illinois state courts  mr  albers  the illinois law does not provide one way or the other  section 4 10 does not say that   this case was reviewed and was enforced by the seventh  circuit as a 502 action  question  but the action was originally brought in state court  was it not  mr albers  i originally brought the action in 24 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25state court to enforce the independent review because the  insurer was refusing to provide any independent review at  all  and the two parts of the statute  the requirement  that there be medical necessity  this review and then the  actual enforcement of the decision  were parsed at the  district court level and in the seventh circuit  judge conlon initially remanded the case after it was removed   finding that the medical necessity portion of the statute  did not offend pilot life or section 502  back in state court  judge kinnaird in chancery found that medical necessity did not offend 502 and  ordered a medical necessity review  the medical necessity review determined that the procedure was medically  necessary  it was then    i then sought payment of the benefit  and that was removed to federal court and judge  conlon found that was a 502 action  question  if the seventh circuit view is upheld by this court  in the future would actions lie in state  court to enforce this  or just under 502  mr  albers  i think consistent with the court s 502 ruling in pilot life  it would be a 502 action to seek  benefits  i think there s a different question with respect to whether it was just the enforcement of the  statute which requires medical necessity  i don t think that then you re seeking the benefit  and i submit that it 25 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25was perfectly appropriate to send this case back to state  court for that determination and that ruling  but  ultimately  to get the benefit  i would suggest that that  would have to come under 502  under the court s reasoning  in pilot life  this case does not conflict with pilot life  as petitioner suggests  in addressing the conflict issue which has been raised  which i think is central to the  decision the court needs to make  i think the court should  consider the burdens that petitioner must meet to show  that conflict  erisa preemption is a defense  question  could the state provide for liquidated damages  do you think    mr  albers  you mean  damages other than the benefit itself  question     under the reinsurance regulation exception  mr  albers  you mean  other than the benefit itself  your honor  question  uh huh  mr  albers  i would submit  under your    the court s ruling which you wrote in pilot life  that it  would probably be inappropriate to go beyond the specific  damages that are permitted in erisa  which is recovery of  the benefit  and i think then under the statute you re 26 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25permitted to recover interest and attorneys s fees  and  that is all deborah moran has ever sought in this case was  the benefit that she was entitled to under the illinois  statute for what was determined to be a medically  necessary procedure  which also saved her right arm  question  how    question  that s true  but the question is  who is to decide she has gotten what she was supposed to get   and the claim here is that that was supposed to be decided  pursuant to one system of review  and the state has  substituted a totally different    mr  albers  and under 514 b   the savings clause  the state has the right to do that  that does not offend erisa in any way  section 503    question  isn t that what pilot life was all about  mr  albers  pilot life did not talk about who the decision maker would be  pilot life talked about the enforcement of the benefit had to be in federal court  under 502  pilot life was a state common law cause of action which was not an insurance law in bad faith and in  contract which sought compensatory and punitive damages  beyond the benefit  the court said  you can t do that  because that offends 502 and  by the way  all    question  i see  so you think all it meant was 27 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25the last shot has to be in federal court  mr  albers  i think it    question  i assume the state could provide that all of these contract claims would be first reviewed in  state court so long as it further provides that the  ultimate judgment of the state court would only be  enforceable by suit in federal court  would that be okay  mr  albers  i think that s    if the state law provided for a judicial review in state court  i think  that would offend 502  the state law does not provide for that  question  arbitration is not another means of review  i mean  i    mr  albers  no  i don t think arbitration is    question  you don t think you change the remedy    mr  albers  no  question     if you say the remedy is not a lawsuit but arbitration  i    mr  albers  the remedy    question  i find that a startling proposition   sure  arbitration has to be enforced in court  but i ve  always thought that that s a separate remedy  you ask  what s your remedy  is it a lawsuit or arbitration  28 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 mr  albers  and this gets down to the issue of what a remedy is  and i looked up remedy in black s law  dictionary  and it has two elements  it has the process  some courts have found  and it also has the result of the  process  the enforcement  and i think in pilot life the  court was talking about the enforcement  not the means of  reaching it  question  okay  consistent with that  in a shorthand kind of way we refer to this as an arbitration   or as an arbitration decision  is the independent reviewer acting really as an arbitrator in the classic  sense  i m assuming that an arbitrator in the classic sense listens to evidence in arguments and decides which  of those evidence and arguments is the better according to  some legal standard  i have assumed  contrast  that what the independent review here is doing is not only listening to  other people  but making a medical judgment himself  as a  physician  if the latter is true  then it doesn t seem to me that it is a classic example of arbitration  but i may  be wrong on that  and i don t want to lead you in the  direction of an analysis that ultimately will not pan out    am i right in distinguishing true arbitration from this   or should we regard this as true arbitration imposed by  state law  29 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 mr  albers  i think this is not    i think you re right  and i think this is not true arbitration as  imposed by state law  i think the court found in pegram that medical necessity decisions contain both elements of  coverage determination and elements of a medical    question  what is    question  may i just ask one    they did in that case  but my concern is  is that true here  in other words  what can you tell me about the terms under  which the reviewer acts that says this is  and in part at  least  or ultimately  an independent decision by the  reviewer about medical necessity as opposed to an  adjudication of which side has the better claim  which an  arbitrator might make  mr  albers  the statute itself  4 10  requires an independent review by a physician in the relevant  specialty  the statute doesn t provide any further guidance with respect to how that review is going to be  done  in this case  it was done de novo  it was done by supplying the relevant definition of medical necessity to  a reviewer from the insurance contract certificate  and  providing all the relevant medical records  question  does it matter under illinois  under the illinois law  whether there s an adequate treatment  that s less expensive  30 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 mr  albers  no  it s de novo review by the independent reviewer  question  and there s no element in it of determining whether there s a slightly less effective  remedy  but with fewer risks and less costly  that s irrelevant  mr  albers  the statute doesn t address that   i think that if that was a part of the definition of  medical necessity that was in the insurance contract  document  that would be relevant to the reviewer s  decision  question  it can be in the insurance contract  those provisions  it wouldn t conflict with illinois law  mr  albers  illinois law does not define medical necessity  and so for our analysis we ve assumed  the only place that the reviewer could go would be to the  plan documents and the plan document here is    there is  no plan document  but the relevant portion of the plan  document is the insurance contract which defined medical  necessity  and that s what the reviewer used  and that s  my understanding of what they intended  question  and how did they define it  what was the definition  mr  albers  there were a variety of factors to consider  what are the available treatments  are they 31 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25accepted generally in the medical practice  question  but wouldn t the    mr  albers  what are the risks  question  i mean  the word necessity sounds like it means you have to have this  and if you had  something that would be equally effective and less  expensive  then it wouldn t be a medical necessity  is this the general understanding of what necessity is  or     you seemed to be saying earlier that it was something  different  mr  albers  i m not sure i understand  question  i thought that    mr  albers  i m sorry  your honor  i m trying to    question  you asked whether  suppose    i think justice o connor asked you  suppose there was effective  treatment that was less expensive  would this particular  treatment still be a medical necessity  and i thought you  answered yes to that question  mr  albers  i think that s up to the judgment of the independent reviewing physician  he certainly can take into account whether there s an equally efficacious  treatment available that s less expensive  and then reach   his judgment as to which one he or she believes is  medically necessary in that circumstance  32 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 question  could i come back to your colloquy with justice souter  the conclusion that you drew is that this is not really arbitration because it s a doctor    what would it take to make it a remedy of arbitration    why isn t it arbitration  suppose a lawyer    suppose the illinois law read just the way it reads now  except it  wouldn t be a medical doctor who posses on this but   rather  a lawyer who would hear medical testimony from  both sides  would that  putting a lawyer in the shoes  convert it to arbitration  mr  albers  my understanding of what justice souter asked me was that it had the traditional elements  of what we consider an arbitration  which is  you review  the evidence from both sides  they have an opportunity to  argue  and then you make a decision  and that s what i  meant when i said it s not classic arbitration  it is like arbitration  in that you give it to a neutral third  party who then makes their review  question  there are no submissions to the doctor in this situation  mr  albers  the illinois law does not provide    and actually what    for the specifics of that   what it does say is that the hmo must set up the  independent review mechanism  and there is no authority in  illinois on what that must contain or not contain  33 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 question  what does it contain  i would find it surprising if both sides didn t press upon the doctor  there their view of the case  you mean  he just sort of walks in blind and    mr  albers  all i can tell you is what happened in this case  your honor  in this case  the hmo submitted a series of questions to the doctor  one of which was     and it included a lot of the elements that justice  ginsburg asked about and justice souter asked about with  respect to  what are the available treatments  are they  less expensive treatments  what are the risks  and so on   and then he was given all of the relevant medical records  and given the definition of medical necessity  and he made  a determination that this particular surgery was medically  necessary  question  and what about your client  did you put any questions to the doctor  mr  albers  we did not  because they covered all the questions we thought were relevant  question  you mean  you don t actually want to know how the system works in illinois  i mean  i m also quite surprised that in the illinois system  which has  been running for sometime  the patient wouldn t have an  opportunity to say to the arbitrator  this is my side of  it  and i would be equally surprised if the doctors who 34 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25think the other way don t have an opportunity to tell the arbitrator what their position is  mr  albers  there s    question  maybe i m always surprised in a lot of things     laughter    question  so tell me i should be surprised  question  may i go back to justice    question  what is the answer  though  what is the answer  do you not    are you not familiar with the system in illinois  mr  albers  your honor  i m probably as familiar as any lawyer in illinois  question  fine  if you re as familiar as anyone  and it s an ongoing system  and i think the    mr  albers  this is the only case  question  this is the only case illinois has ever had  mr  albers  this is the only legal case that s ever been brought under the medical necessity statute  question  no  is this the only case in which the arbitration system has ever worked in illinois  mr  albers  i have no data on that  and the state doesn t keep data on that  i did ask    question  do you accept that this is an 35 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25arbitration system  then  do i understand that in your response to these questions  you think it is an arbitration system  mr  albers  i think it is an arbitration  and then it goes to a neutral third party    question  well  i would be amazed if people    i mean  am i right to be amazed that you have a system  where people can t make arguments    mr  albers  i    question     or can t present their point of view to the arbitrator  i ve never come across such a thing  and i take it    mr  albers  there s nothing in the law that precludes either one of the parties from    question  could i ask you a slightly different question  which is the thing that    i d very much  appreciate  before your time expires  if you could just  address for at least a minute or so what i think is a  difficult aspect of the case  why is this insurance  that is  what i m thinking is that  after all  every company that sells a product with a warranty is to  that extent an insurer  every credit card that says you can return defective merchandise is to that extent an  insurer  every manufacturer  even without a warranty  who accepts a product back because it s defective is an 36 alderson reporting

clause to allow states to win conflicts that broadly  so  why does this fall within the kind of insurer that must  fall within this savings clause  mr  albers  i think the court in pegram    and it wasn t the issue before the court in pegram  but said  that hmo s act like insurers and transfer risks like  insurers  and the illinois statute defines an hmo as an  entity that bears risk  question  that s why i gave my example  because i wanted you to see that virtually every manufacturer of  the united states is a insurer in that sense  and so is  this the kind of thing that illinois has traditionally  regulated  is it the kind of thing that other insurance commissioners have tended to regulate  what makes this an insurer different from general motors  mr  albers  yes to both those questions  the hmo insurance act is part of the illinois insurance code   and i think that insurance law meets all the factors the  court has set forth in its prior decisions with respect to  what constitutes an insurer  question  what about a law firm that handles all of the client s legal business  just as an hmo handles  all of the client s medical business  for a flat fee  and 37 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25there are firms that do this  especially in the labor  field  many unions just hire a firm to handle all of the union members  legal business for the whole year  is that law firm  like this hmo  an insurer  mr  albers  i don t think so  that s    it s not a    question  what s the difference  mr  albers  they re not a traditional insurer  question  one is providing legal services  and they don t know how much it s going to come to for the  year  and the other one is providing medical services and  they don t know how much it s going to come to for the  year  mr  albers  well  laws regulating them would not be directed to them as acting as insurers  they re not traditional insurers  they don t meet the common sense definition of what an insurer    question  i don t think an hmo does  either   i    mr  albers  this law is limited to the insurance industry  it s limited to hmo s when they bear risk  it does transfer risk by the very operation of the statute  the seventh circuit and the fifth circuit agree  that this is a statute which regulates insurance  and  under this court s precedents set forth in unum  the court 38 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25doesn t ordinarily disturb that determination of state  law  so i would    i respectfully submit that it is an  insurance company for purposes of what regulates insurance  under 514 b   question  well  i think the question of what s insurance under erisa is a federal question  not a state  mr  albers  yes  that s    for purposes of 514 b   but you look at those factors  and one relevant  factor is whether it    whether the state considers it to  be an insurer or whether it regulates it as an insurer   and in both situations it does here  in conclusion  i would suggest  in response to justice souter s question to petitioner  that this case  falls squarely between the court s two precedents in  massachusetts  metropolitan life in massachusetts and  unum  it contains a procedural element of medical necessity  which is the relevant rule decision  just as  the unum case determined that the notice prejudice rule  was the relevant rule of decision  and it contains a  substantive element  which is a mandated benefit term    once the medical necessity determination is made  that is  a mandated benefit  and i submit to accept petitioner s  argument this court would have to reverse its decisions in  unum  in metropolitan  and in fmc  the effect    i think justice o connor raises 39 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25this issue  what would be the effect of such a ruling on  voluntary agreements  and i agree with the proposition  that if there s a conflict between independent review and  502  then the parties couldn t even agree to provide  independent review  which would change the practice across  the country  because it is being provided by self insured  plans and by hmo s  under 514 b   i submit that this is a state insurance law which looked to harmonize the effect of that  law and affirmed the states can regulate insurance and can  regulate insurers  medical necessity decisions by leaving  those medical decisions to doctors  who should be making  them  if there s no other questions    question  may i just ask  on the question of whether it s an insurance company  does the state  insurance agency regulate the    you  in fact  would say  the contract between the employer  the sort of unnamed  employer that ray talks about  and the hmo  is an  insurance policy  mr  albers  yes  question  does the illinois insurance commission regulate the terms of that policy in any  respect  other than this 510    this 4 10 c  provision  mr  albers  yes  there s an entire statute 40 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25which regulates the terms  and there are  for example   minimum benefit requirements for breast cancer treatments   for mental health coverage  there are requirements for  minimum funding  for reserves  and so on  so there s all  the traditional    question  is the policy that this hmo issued to this employer the same form policy it issues to many other  purchasers of hmo services from it  mr  albers  i can only assume it is  i have no evidence on that  your honor  question  very well  mr  albers  mr  kneedler  we ll hear from you  oral argument of edwin s  kneedler on behalf of the united states  as amicus curiaemr  kneedler  mr  chief justice  and may it please the court  the claim is made here that the section 4 10 of the illinois hmo act conflicts with section 502 a   in considering that claim  it s important to focus on the  language of exactly what 502 a  addresses  and it is set  out on page 2 of the petition  502 a  is empowered    question  502 of the petition  mr  kneedler  of the petition  yes  it s entitled   persons empowered to bring a civil action   and  then it itemizes    it then continues  a civil action may  be brought by various persons  and then it goes on to 41 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25describe the judicial relief that may be granted  awarded  in a suit under section 502 a   in other words  the preemptive scope of section 502 a  has to do with causes  of action  civil suits in court  and the judicial relief  that may be awarded in court  and that is precisely the  formulation that the court used in pilot life itself  at the conclusion of the court s opinion in pilot life  the court said in distinguishing metropolitan  life  the court said the court in metropolitan life had no  occasion to consider the question presented in this case   whether congress might clearly express through 502 a  an  intention that federal  the federal remedy provided by  that provision displaced state causes of action  and  that s what the question was about in unum  here  section 4    excuse me  in pilot life  here  section 4 10 of the illinois hmo statute does not provide a state cause of action in court  and it  does not provide any remedy or relief beyond what s  available under the plan itself  question  well  you could look at it that way  or you could look at it that it provides  the state law  provides a cause of action before this arbitrator  mr  kneedler  i don t think that s the way it    question  you have a claim before the 42 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25arbitrator that you haven t gotten what is medically  necessary  and the arbitrator shall resolve that cause of  action just as  under erisa  the court would have resolved  what the contract said   mr  kneedler  i don t think that s the ordinary understanding of what a cause of action is  a cause of action is ordinarily regarded as something that you would  enforce directly in court  question  so the only remedies that you can t displace erisa with are judicial remedies  you can provide for any other kind of relief  mr  kneedler  well  i    my point is  that s what section 502 a  addresses  and the analysis in pilot  life was  what does 502 a  displace  and it s    another  important feature of pilot life is  the court went through  the various remedies that section 502 a  provides  and  tellingly discussed this court s decision in russell in  which the court held that punitive damages were not  available in a suit against a fiduciary based on claims  processing  and the court said it was not going to allow a  state cause of action to displace congress  judgment about  damage remedies to allow and not to allow  or have    question  well  mr  kneedler  supposing the state provided for a very elaborate arbitration procedure   you know  with right to counsel  specified the way the 43 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25hearing should be conducted and so forth  but didn t say  what would happen  it just said the view of the arbitrator would be final  that would not be preempted  in your view  by 502 because it doesn t contemplate  judicial enforcement  mr  kneedler  yes  and if it also did not provide for relief beyond that was available in the plan  itself  question  well  supposing that after that you could just simply bring an action under 502  mr  kneedler  i think that would not be preempted  in fact  most states    in this case  illinois has not tightly regulated the form in which the  independent review will occur  and that s consistent with  the fact that these are highly judgmental medical  judgments that medical professionals are looking at  question  that may be  but i want to go back to the chief justice s question for a minute  just assume the absurd example in which the state provided that there  are going to be sort of 10 steps of arbitration and review  between the initial denial by the plan fiduciary and the  right to sue  so that someone would be tied up for months  or years before the person could get into court  in each instance  i m assuming that it would not be a provision by the state of a cause of action in the 44 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25sense that you have been using it  and yet wouldn t you  concede in that case that the state scheme was keeping  people out of federal court for enforcement so long that  it would  in fact  be in conflict and would be preempted  mr  kneedler  i think the analysis there would be one of exhaustion of remedies under the plan  including  those required    question  and if the exhaustion was exhausting  wouldn t you say that the    mr  kneedler  yes  it could be excused  and the department of labor s regulations  and they    question  no  but there would be a preemption in that case  mr  kneedler  there would be a preemption  but the department of labor has addressed that under its  claims processing regulations  section 503 provides for a fair administrative processing of claims  and a  separate    question  okay  but doesn t that mean  then  that your answers to the several questions on this should  be  it ultimately is a question of degree  this  requirement of one step in a review process doesn t reach  the point  in effect  of excluding the federal remedy  mr  kneedler  right  it does not stand as an obstacle  45 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 another point that the court stressed in pilot life was that the congress struck a balance between the  prompt and fair processing of claims and suits in court    well  but arbitration and independent review  measures  adopted by state insurance laws of this sort  are  precisely designed to facilitate the prompt and fair and  expeditious processing of claims without having to go to  court  so it    question  mr  kneedler  doesn t it give you a very different remedy    i mean  to say that it isn t just  a matter of delay  that isn t the problem here  the problem here is that under the plan  the plan manager s  determination was to be given deference by the federal  court in deciding whether the plan had been complied with   whereas under the scheme set up by the state  his  determination is not to be given deference  it s this third party who s been brought in who will have the last  word  and unless that s arbitrary  the court will enforce  what he says  how can that possibly be regarded as the same remedy that erisa provided  mr  kneedler  nothing in section 502    and this court made this clear in firestone    specifies the  standard of review  the court therefore looked to background principles of law there  in trust law  the court here might look to background principles of 46 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25arbitration law  and also to the terms of the plan  state law  as justice o connor pointed out  might well be able to say that that sort of provision for  deference to the plan administrator s interpretation of  the plan should not be given  that would be a classic regulation of state insurance law  i want to mention one other point about the characterization of pilot life  and that is this court s  decision in unum  the court there said  whatever the merits of unum s view of section 502 a  s preemptive  force  the issue is not implicated here  the court then went on to say why  because ward sued under 502 a  1  b   itself to recover benefits it was not a displacement of  the federal remedy  it was an invocation of the federal  remedy to recover benefits  and the court said in that  cause of action  the notice prejudice rule of california  insurance law supplied the rule of decision  so  too  here  in the cause of action under section 502 a  1  b  the state illinois hmo law supplies  the rule of decision  a procedure for an independent  reviewer to give a quick  prompt review of the claim  and  that independent reviewer s decision is    then supplies  the rule of decision that the hmo must comply with  and  that is then subject to review in federal court  the claimant s right to go to court is not 47 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25frustrated  he can seek review of the arbitrator s decision  or  as we point out in our brief  he can bypass  this procedure altogether and can go directly to court   and so 502 a  1  b  confers rights on claimants  not on  plans  nothing in the hmo act stands as an obstacle to the claimant s ability to go directly to court  another important point about unum is  the court made clear that the processing of claims under an  insurance policy  it is an integral part of that insurance  policy  but at the same time states may regulate the  process by which claims are adjudicated  and that is  precisely what the state has done in this case  it has provided a familiar mechanism  40 states now have provided for this external sort of review  and it is  common in insurance and medical practice to provide by  second opinions by physicians  so what has been provided  here is a very familiar sort of approach  one other point about section 502  it s patterned after section 301 of the lmra  an arbitration  preceding judicial review is a very familiar aspect of  judicial review under section 301  section 301 itself does not provide for any particular standard of review    you can have de novo breach of contract suits  as in the  bowen v  postal service case we mentioned in our brief  or  highly deferential standards of review where the 48 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25particular issue has been committed to an arbitrable  process  502 has the same flexibility  it can have a direct de novo cause of action  as the court contemplated  in firestone  or  where the parties  underlying agreement  or contract provides for a separate resolution process   there is deference to that process under section 502  question  thank you  mr  kneedler  mr  roberts  you have 4 minutes remaining  rebuttal argument of john g  roberts  jr  on behalf of the petitioner mr  roberts  thank you  mr  chief justice  my friend mr  kneedler again drew the analogy to the labor management relations act  and we are on common  ground  that s a good analogy  he again stopped one step short  a state law that compelled the parties to a collective bargaining agreement to resolve their disputes  in a particular manner  even arbitration  would surely be  preempted under the labor management relations act and  to  the extent this remedy is similar to arbitration  that  same conclusion applies  we heard that there s no interference with 502 because beneficiaries have the option  they can use the federal remedy  or they can use the state remedy  the existence of an alternative remedy is  in fact  an 49 alderson reporting company 1111 14th street  n w  suite 400 1 800 for depo washington  dc 20005 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25interference with section 502  and that test is that  option with the beneficiary is peculiarly inappropriate  when you re talking about preemption  preemption often is the result of a quid pro quo  we re going to give  say  employees a federal remedy  but for the employers we re going to make it  exclusive  to say that additional remedies are okay so long as the employee can still resort to the federal  remedy seems to ignore the typical dynamic of preemption  and as far as the arbitration analogy goes  the fact that the plans may or may not be able to voluntarily  adopt such a remedy doesn t mean the state can compel it    nothing prevented the plan in egelhoff from voluntarily  opting the beneficiary designation rule at issue there    that didn t keep this court from ruling that it was  preempted  nothing preempted the plan in greater washington board of trade from saying  we re going to  provide the same level of benefit to people on worker s  comp as to others  and yet a rule mandating that was  preempted  we re dealing here with a compelled alternative state law remedy that changes completely the standard of  review available under the federal remedy  it s not surprising the results under the two remedies came out  differently  that additional remedy is preempted
